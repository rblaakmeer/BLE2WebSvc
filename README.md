## Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing. The tests cover the core logic in `ble-manager.js` (using mocks for the `noble` BLE library) and the API endpoints in `server.js` (using `supertest` and mocks for `ble-manager.js`).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Git (to clone the repository).

### Steps to Run Tests

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd BLE2WebSvc 
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this repository).

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install both runtime and development dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the tests:**
    Execute the test script defined in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
    This will run Jest, which will discover and execute the test files (located in the `__tests__` directory). You should see output in your console indicating the status of the tests (pass/fail) and any coverage information if configured.

3. **Push the code** to your balena application:
   ```bash
   git remote add balena <your-balena-git-endpoint>
   git push balena main
   ```

### Docker Support

The project includes Docker support for containerized deployment. The container will:
- Install Node.js v16

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied for BLE Access:**
   ```bash
   sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
   ```

2. **Node.js Version Compatibility:**
   - Ensure Node.js version is 16.16.0 or higher but less than 17.0.0
   - Run `npm run check-version` to verify

3. **Bluetooth Service Not Running:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start bluetooth
   sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
   ```

4. **Noble Installation Issues:**
   - Install system dependencies: `sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev`
   - Rebuild native modules: `npm rebuild`

### Logs and Debugging

- Check server logs for API errors
- Use browser developer tools for web interface debugging
- Enable Noble debug mode: `DEBUG=noble* npm start`
